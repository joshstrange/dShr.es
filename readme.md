### About dShr.es

dShr.es is built on top of Laravel and all of it's source code is right here! The code is messy but it works. Feel free to improve on it, I will accept Pull requests. Also dShr.es use to be names Drop.Sh/are but due to Dropbox naming rules it had to change. Unrelated if anyone is looking to buy the domain Drop.sh it is for SALE!

### About Me

My name is [Josh Strange](http://josh.vc) and I am a web and mobile developer living in Lexington, KY. I built dShr.es in my free time and kept it open source so that I could give back and so that I could better learn how to use git.
